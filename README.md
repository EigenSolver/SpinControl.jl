# SpinEnsembles.jl

**SpinEnsembles.jl** is a numerical package written in Julia that makes it easy to simulate the decoherence process and analyze the dynamical decoupling protocols in interacting spin ensembles.

<!-- Theoretical study on the dynamics of a disordered spin ensemble.

- Electronic spin 1/2, randomly distributed
- Dipolar interaction
- Strong background field
- Driving via an external magnetic field -->
