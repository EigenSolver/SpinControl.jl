# Master Thesis Project @ TU Delft

Theoretical study on the dynamics of a spin ensemble.

- Highly disordered quantum many body system
- Electronic spin 1/2, randomly distributed in the crystal
- Strong background field
- Control via a external magnetic field
  

The dynamics can be studied in both theoretical and numerical approach

1. Write the Hamiltonian of the system, add a transverse term and do a derivation for the FID curve
2. Construct the Hamiltonian numerical and perform time evolution

Possible package used in the project
- QuantumOptics.jl
