# SpinEnsembles.jl

**SpinEnsembles.jl** is a numerical package written in Julia that makes it easy to simulate the decoherence process and analyze the dynamical decoupling protocols in interacting spin ensembles.

Analysis on the dynamics of a disordered spin ensemble.

- Spin 1/2, positional disorder, randomly distributed
- Dipole-dipole interactions of unlike spins, 
- Driving by external magnetic fields
